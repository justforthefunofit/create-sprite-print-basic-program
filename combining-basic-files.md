# Merging TWO BASIC Program Files ‚Äî part-1 + part-2

This little guide shows how to **merge two BASIC program files** named `part-1` and `part-2` into a single, running program.  
The method is based on the *merging procedure* described in *Peeks and Pokes on the Commodore 64* (Liesert, 1st edition, 1985), page 41.
A pdf document of this can be found on the web-archive. 

This we now use to merge the generated sprite printing lines with the program in which we want to use them.

## üß© Step-by-Step Merge Guide 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Load the first part  
- Load `part-1` into memory (e.g. `LOAD "part-1",8`).  
- Make sure it sits safely in memory.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Note the end-of-program pointer  
- Find the memory address at the end of `part-1` (this is where the next line will be appended).  
- This address is stored in pointers at the top of BASIC memory.
- for this we read the memory location using the peek command:
<code>
  print peek(43), peek(44)    make a note of those two values
  poke 43, (peek(45)+256*peek(46)-2) and 255
  poke 44, (peek(45)+256*peek(46)-2)/256
  new
</code>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Load the second part   
- Use `LOAD "part-2",8  
- This loads part-2 directly after part-1 in memory.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix the pointers  
- Update the first two bytes (low, high) of part-2‚Äôs first line to point to the correct memory address where part-2 now resides.  
- this we do with the two value we fount with the peek (43) and peek(44)
 <code>
  poke 43, value-1
  poke 44, value-2
  </code>
  
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Save the combined program  
- Once merged and pointer-adjusted, save the entire combined program (e.g. `SAVE "merged",8`)  
- You now have a single file that runs both parts in sequence.

## Using the merged program
